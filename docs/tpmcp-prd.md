## Claude Code Implementation Guide

> **READ THIS FIRST.** This section defines how Claude Code should approach building this project to maintain quality through context compaction.

### Progress Tracking System

**Always maintain `PROGRESS.md` in the project root.** This file survives compaction and is your source of truth.

```markdown
# Project Progress

## Current Phase
MVP / V1 / Complete

## Last Completed Task
[task-id] - Brief description - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

## Next Task
[task-id] - Brief description

## Blockers
- None / List any blockers

## Completed Tasks
- [x] [AUTH-01] Keyring storage implementation
- [x] [AUTH-02] Cookie validation
- [ ] [TOOL-01] tp_get_profile tool
...

## Architecture Decisions
- Decision 1: Rationale
- Decision 2: Rationale

## Known Issues
- Issue 1: Description, workaround
```

**Update `PROGRESS.md` after completing each task.** This is non-negotiable.

### Sub-Agent Strategy

Use sub-agents (via `Task`) for isolated, well-defined work. Each sub-agent should:
1. Receive a specific task ID and clear deliverables
2. Have access to relevant files only
3. Return with a status report

**When to spawn sub-agents:**
- Implementing a single tool (one sub-agent per tool)
- Writing tests for a module
- Security audit of a component
- Documentation generation

**When NOT to spawn sub-agents:**
- Cross-cutting concerns (auth affects everything)
- Architectural decisions
- Debugging integration issues

### Task Breakdown

Each task has an ID for tracking. Complete tasks in order within each phase.

### Sub-Agent Prompt Template

When spawning a sub-agent, use this structure:

```
Task: [TASK-ID] - [Task Name]

Context:
- Project: TrainingPeaks MCP Server
- Phase: MVP/V1
- This task's role in the system: [brief explanation]

Files to read first:
- PROGRESS.md (check current state)
- [relevant existing files]

Deliverables:
1. [Specific file/function to create]
2. [Tests if applicable]
3. Update to PROGRESS.md marking task complete

Constraints:
- Follow existing code patterns
- No credentials in logs/errors
- Terse tool descriptions (<50 tokens)
- Update PROGRESS.md when done

Do not:
- Modify unrelated files
- Change architecture without documenting in PROGRESS.md
- Skip tests
```

### Recovery After Compaction

When context is compacted, Claude Code should:

1. **Read `PROGRESS.md` first** — This tells you where you are
2. **Read the PRD** — Refresh on requirements and constraints
3. **Check `git log --oneline -20`** — See recent commits
4. **Resume from "Next Task"** in PROGRESS.md

### Commit Convention

```
[TASK-ID] Brief description

- Detail 1
- Detail 2
```

Example:
```
[AUTH-01] Implement keyring credential storage

- Add store_credential(), get_credential(), clear_credential()
- Handle keyring.errors.NoKeyringError gracefully
- Tests passing
```

### Quality Gates

Before marking a task complete:

1. **Code runs** — No syntax errors, imports work
2. **Tests pass** — `pytest tests/` green
3. **Types check** — `mypy src/` clean (if types added)
4. **No credential leaks** — Grep for cookie values, auth tokens
5. **PROGRESS.md updated** — Task checked off, next task identified

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for TrainingPeaks that enables AI assistants to read workout data, create and move workouts, and analyse power/pace peaks. The server uses TrainingPeaks' internal API via session cookie authentication—the only viable path since TrainingPeaks restricts its official API to approved commercial partners.

**Core principles:**
1. **Security first** — Credentials never logged, stored in system keyring, zero plaintext exposure
2. **Token efficient** — Minimal tool count, terse descriptions, lazy loading where possible
3. **Pragmatic** — Cookie-based auth with manual extraction (proven pattern from tp2intervals)
4. **Phased delivery** — Read-only MVP, then write operations in V1

---

## Problem Statement

TrainingPeaks is widely used by endurance athletes and coaches but has no public API for personal use. Existing tools like tp2intervals prove that the internal API (`tpapi.trainingpeaks.com`) works reliably with session cookie authentication. Athletes want to query their training data, analyse performance trends, and manage workouts through AI assistants without switching contexts to the TrainingPeaks web app.

**Why not use existing solutions?**
- AI Endurance MCP requires a separate subscription and syncs via their platform
- tp2intervals is a standalone sync tool, not an MCP server
- No TrainingPeaks MCP server exists

---

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Read all workout data (planned and completed) for arbitrary date ranges
- Create structured workouts in the workout library
- Move/reschedule workouts on the calendar
- Analyse peak power and pace data
- Bulletproof credential security — zero chance of leaking user credentials
- Minimal context window consumption (<2,000 tokens for tool definitions)
- Clear re-authentication flow when cookies expire

### Non-Goals
- Coach/athlete relationship management
- Social features or sharing
- Direct Garmin/Strava sync (use native TP integrations)
- Automated cookie extraction from browser (too fragile, security concerns)
- Remote/hosted deployment (local stdio only for MVP/V1)

---

## Technical Architecture

### Authentication Strategy

**Method:** Manual session cookie extraction (tp2intervals pattern)

TrainingPeaks uses the `Production_tpAuth` cookie for API authentication. Users extract this cookie from browser DevTools and provide it to the MCP server. This approach:
- Avoids platform-specific browser decryption code
- Doesn't trigger OS permission prompts
- Has proven reliability (tp2intervals has used it for years)
- Keeps the user in control of their credentials

**Cookie extraction flow:**
1. User logs into TrainingPeaks in browser
2. Opens DevTools → Network tab
3. Navigates to any tpapi.trainingpeaks.com request
4. Copies the `Production_tpAuth` cookie value
5. Runs `tp-mcp auth` CLI command and pastes when prompted
6. Cookie is validated against `/users/v3/token` endpoint
7. On success, stored in system keyring

### Credential Storage Hierarchy

**Primary: System Keyring**
```
Service: trainingpeaks-mcp
Username: production_tpauth
Password: <cookie_value>
```

Uses Python `keyring` library which maps to:
- macOS: Keychain
- Windows: Credential Locker  
- Linux: Secret Service (GNOME Keyring / KWallet)

**Fallback: Encrypted file** (for headless/container environments)
```
~/.config/trainingpeaks-mcp/credentials.enc
```
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- Key derived from machine-specific identifier + user password
- File permissions: `chmod 600`
- Directory permissions: `chmod 700`

**Environment variable override:** `TP_AUTH_COOKIE`
- For CI/testing only
- Documented with security warnings
- Never used if keyring is available

### Security Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| No plaintext storage | Keyring primary, encrypted file fallback |
| No credential logging | Redact in all log output, error messages |
| No credential in process args | Read from keyring/file, never CLI args |
| No credential in tool responses | Strip from any API response data |
| Validation on startup | Fail fast if auth invalid |
| Clear expiry handling | Detect 401, prompt re-auth, never retry with bad creds |
| No network exposure | stdio transport only (localhost) |
| Minimal permissions | Read-only mode by default |

**Credential lifecycle:**
```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ User pastes │────▶│ Validate via │────▶│ Store in    │
│ cookie      │     │ /users/v3/   │     │ keyring     │
└─────────────┘     │ token        │     └─────────────┘
                    └──────────────┘            │
                           │                    ▼
                    ┌──────┴──────┐     ┌─────────────┐
                    │ 401/403?    │◀────│ Load on     │
                    │ Clear creds │     │ server start│
                    │ Prompt re-  │     └─────────────┘
                    │ auth        │
                    └─────────────┘
```

### API Endpoints

Base URL: `https://tpapi.trainingpeaks.com`

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/users/v3/token` | GET | Validate auth, get user info |
| `/users/v3/user` | GET | Get athlete ID and profile |
| `/fitness/v6/athletes/{id}/workouts/{start}/{end}` | GET | Fetch workouts by date range |
| `/fitness/v1/athletes/{id}/workouts/{workoutId}` | GET | Get single workout details |
| `/fitness/v1/athletes/{id}/workouts/{workoutId}` | PUT | Update workout (move date) |
| `/exerciselibrary/v1/libraries/{id}/items` | POST | Create workout in library |
| `/fitness/v3/athletes/{id}/powerpeaks` | GET | Power peak data |
| `/fitness/v3/athletes/{id}/pacepeaks` | GET | Pace peak data |

**Note:** Exact endpoints need validation via network traffic analysis. The above are based on tp2intervals and similar tools.

### Transport

**stdio only** — The server runs as a local subprocess spawned by the MCP client (Claude Desktop, etc). This:
- Eliminates network attack surface
- Simplifies deployment
- Matches security-sensitive MCP servers (filesystem, git)
- Avoids SSE/HTTP session management complexity

---

## Tool Design

### Design Principles

Based on MCP best practices research:

1. **Minimal tool count** — 5 tools for MVP, 8 for V1. Fewer tools = better LLM selection accuracy
2. **Terse descriptions** — Under 50 tokens per tool. No verbose explanations
3. **Polymorphic parameters** — One `get_workouts` tool with date filters, not separate tools per query type
4. **Structured responses** — Return only essential fields, not full API responses
5. **Actionable errors** — Tell the LLM how to fix problems, not just what went wrong

### Token Budget

**Target:** <2,000 tokens for all tool definitions

| Component | Token estimate |
|-----------|---------------|
| Tool names + descriptions (8 tools) | ~600 tokens |
| Parameter schemas | ~800 tokens |
| Response type hints | ~400 tokens |
| **Total** | ~1,800 tokens |

Compare to garth-mcp which consumes 66,000+ tokens on init.

## Error Handling

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "isError": true,
  "error_code": "AUTH_EXPIRED",
  "message": "Session expired. Run 'tp-mcp auth' to re-authenticate.",
  "recoverable": true,
  "suggested_action": "Call tp_auth_status to confirm, then re-authenticate"
}
```

### Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | LLM Action |
|------|---------|------------|
| `AUTH_EXPIRED` | Cookie expired | Tell user to re-auth |
| `AUTH_INVALID` | Cookie malformed | Tell user to re-auth |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Workout/resource doesn't exist | Check ID, inform user |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many requests | Wait and retry |
| `PREMIUM_REQUIRED` | Feature needs premium account | Inform user |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Bad parameters | Fix parameters |
| `API_ERROR` | TrainingPeaks API issue | Retry or inform user |

### Timeout Handling

- API calls: 30 second timeout
- Auth validation: 10 second timeout
- On timeout: Return error with retry suggestion, don't hang

---

---

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trainingpeaks": {
      "command": "tp-mcp",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** No credentials in config. Server reads from keyring on startup.

### Environment Variables (Advanced)

| Variable | Purpose | Security |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `TP_AUTH_COOKIE` | Override keyring (CI/testing) | ⚠️ Use with caution |
| `TP_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` | Debug logging | Safe |
| `TP_MCP_TIMEOUT` | API timeout seconds | Safe |
| `TP_MCP_READ_ONLY` | Force read-only mode | Safe (default: true for MVP) |

## Appendix E: Compaction Recovery Checklist

When Claude Code resumes after context compaction:

```
□ Read PROGRESS.md - understand current state
□ Read this PRD - refresh on requirements  
□ Check git status - any uncommitted work?
□ Check git log --oneline -10 - recent changes
□ Identify next task from PROGRESS.md
□ Read relevant source files for that task
□ Continue implementation
□ Update PROGRESS.md when task complete
□ Commit with [TASK-ID] prefix
```
